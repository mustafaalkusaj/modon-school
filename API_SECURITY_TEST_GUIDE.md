# 🔐 API SECURITY TEST GUIDE
**Branch Isolation & Authorization Testing via API**

---

## PREREQUISITES

### 1. Get Authentication Token

**Option A: From Browser DevTools**
```
1. Open modon-school.com in Chrome
2. Press F12 to open DevTools
3. Go to Console tab
4. Paste this code:

const token = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('sb-school-iraq-com-auth-token'));
const accessToken = token?.session?.access_token;
console.log('TOKEN:', accessToken);

4. Copy the full token string (starts with 'eyJ...')
```

**Option B: From Network Tab**
```
1. Open Network tab
2. Perform any API call (e.g., load /ar/students)
3. Look for API request like GET /api/core/students
4. Click the request and go to Headers tab
5. Find "Authorization" header
6. Copy the Bearer token value (without "Bearer ")
```

### 2. Get Branch IDs

**From UI:**
```
1. Login to account (zena3, saif1, or zena1)
2. Open DevTools > Network tab
3. Load /ar/students
4. Look for API response from /api/core/students
5. Check response body for branch_id value
6. Record these UUIDs:
   - Primary Branch UUID
   - Boys Secondary Branch UUID
   - Girls Secondary Branch UUID
```

## 🧪 TEST SCENARIOS

### TEST 1: Branch Admin Accessing Own Branch (SHOULD SUCCEED)

**Account:** zena3@modon-school.com (Primary Branch)

```bash
# Get list of students (should work - owns this branch)
curl -X GET 'https://modon-school.com/api/core/students?page=1&limit=50' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ZENA3_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

# Expected Response: 200 OK
# Expected: Array of students with branch_id matching Primary branch
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "uuid1",
      "full_name": "Student Name",
      "branch_id": "primary-branch-uuid",
      "school_id": "al-nakheel-uuid",
      ...
    },
    ...
  ],
  "total": 121,
  "page": 1
}
```

---

### TEST 2: Branch Admin Accessing Other Branch (SHOULD FAIL)

**Account:** zena3@modon-school.com (Primary Branch Only)  
**Attempting:** Access Boys Secondary data

curl -X GET 'https://modon-school.com/api/core/students' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ZENA3_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

# ❌ The list should NOT include Boys Secondary students
# ❌ If students from other branches appear = SECURITY BREACH
```

---

### TEST 3: Create Student - Branch ID Must Match

**Account:** zena3@modon-school.com  
**Attempting:** Create legitimate student in Primary branch

  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ZENA3_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "nameAr": "QA طالب ابتدائية",
    "nameEn": "QA Primary Student",
    "registrationNumber": "QA-2026-001",
    "dateOfBirth": "2010-01-15",
    "status": "active",
    "classId": "some-valid-primary-class-uuid",
    "branchId": "primary-branch-uuid"
  }'

# Expected: 201 Created
# Expected: Student created with branch_id = primary-branch-uuid
```

**Expected Response:**
```json

    "status": "active",
    "classId": "boys-secondary-class-uuid",
    "branchId": "boys-secondary-branch-uuid"
  }'

# ❌ SHOULD FAIL
# Expected: 403 Forbidden
# Expected Error: "You do not have access to this branch"

# ✗ SECURITY BREACH IF: 201 Created
# ✗ SECURITY BREACH IF: Student created in wrong branch
```

**Expected Response (SAFE):**
```json
{
  "error": "Forbidden: You do not have access to this branch",
  "code": 403
}
```

  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "hacker-student-uuid",
    "full_name": "Hacker Attempt",
    "branch_id": "boys-secondary-branch-uuid"  // ❌ WRONG BRANCH
  }
}
```

---

### TEST 5: ATTACK - POST Without branchId Parameter

**Account:** zena3@modon-school.com

```bash
# MISSING BRANCH ID
curl -X POST 'https://modon-school.com/api/core/students' \

# ✗ FAIL if: System auto-assigns a branch (dangerous fallback)
```

**Expected Response:**
```json

## 📊 DATABASE AUDIT QUERIES

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify data integrity:

### Query 1: QA Records Verification
```sql
-- Verify QA students are in correct branches
SELECT 
  s.id,
  s.full_name,
  s.branch_id,
  b.name as branch_name,
  s.created_at
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN branches b ON b.id = s.branch_id
WHERE s.full_name ILIKE '%QA%'
ORDER BY s.created_at DESC;

-- Expected: Each row shows correct branch_name
-- ✗ FAIL if: QA-Primary appears in Boys Secondary branch
```

### Query 2: Orphaned Records (No Branch ID)
```sql
-- Check for records missing branch_id
SELECT COUNT(*) as orphaned_count
FROM students
WHERE branch_id IS NULL
  AND created_at > now() - interval '7 days'
  AND deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Expected: 0 rows
-- ✗ FAIL if: Any count > 0
```

### Query 3: Payment/Student Branch Mismatch
```sql
-- Verify payments match their student's branch
SELECT COUNT(*) as mismatches
FROM payments p
JOIN students s ON s.id = p.student_id
WHERE p.branch_id <> s.branch_id
  AND p.deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Expected: 0 rows
-- ✗ FAIL if: Any count > 0 (data corruption)
```

### Query 4: Salary/Teacher Branch Mismatch
```sql
-- Verify salaries match their teacher's branch
SELECT COUNT(*) as mismatches
FROM salaries sa
JOIN teachers t ON t.id = sa.teacher_id
WHERE sa.branch_id <> t.branch_id
  AND sa.deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Expected: 0 rows
-- ✗ FAIL if: Any count > 0
```

### Query 5: RLS Policy Test
```sql
-- Verify RLS actually restricts access
-- Run as authenticated user zena3 (Primary branch only)

SELECT COUNT(*) as primary_students
FROM students
WHERE branch_id = (
  SELECT id FROM branches WHERE name ILIKE '%ابتدائية%'
);

-- Expected: 121+ (includes QA records)

-- Now try to query boys secondary (should return 0 due to RLS)
-- This would require switching user context, so manual verification needed
```
