- [x] NODE_ENV=production
- [x] HTTPS enforced in production
- [x] CORS properly configured
- [x] Rate limiting enabled
- [x] Audit logging functional
- [x] All errors sanitized (no data leakage)

# Get token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"pass"}' | jq -r '.token')

## 📈 Monitoring

### Recommended Monitoring Tools

1. **Error Tracking**: Sentry (set NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN)
2. **Uptime Monitoring**: Uptime.com or similar
3. **Database Monitoring**: Your database provider's dashboard
4. **API Monitoring**: Postman or similar
5. **Log Aggregation**: ELK Stack or CloudWatch

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- API response times (target: <100ms)
- Database query times (target: <5ms)
- Error rates (target: <0.1%)
- Authentication failures (monitor for attacks)
- Audit log volume (ensure proper logging)
- Disk usage (soft deletes don't free space)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database Connection Error**
```
Solution: Verify DATABASE_URL is correct and database is running
```

**JWT Token Errors**
```
Solution: Regenerate JWT_SECRET with secure random value
```

**Branch Access Denied**
```
Solution: Check user's branch assignment in database
```

**Performance Issues**
```
Solution: Run: npm run prisma:generate && npm run prisma:migrate
```

See [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed troubleshooting.
