# Figma Redesign Sync Report

**Generated:** April 9, 2026  
**Project:** School Application (modon-school)

---

## Figma MCP Status

| Status | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Availability** | NOT available |
| **Reason** | No Figma MCP server or plugin connected to the development environment |
| **Impact** | Direct Figma file creation was not possible during redesign |

---

## What Was Created in Figma

**Nothing** — No direct Figma file creation was possible during this redesign effort.

The redesign was implemented directly in code, with the existing `figma-handoff/` documentation serving as the design reference.

---

## What Docs Were Updated

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `theme-verification-report.md` | Verification of 14 theme presets, token mapping, and runtime branding |
| `remaining-style-violations.md` | Documentation of remaining hardcoded style violations in non-priority modules |

---

## Existing Handoff Files

The `figma-handoff/` directory contains the design reference package:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tokens.css` | Design token definitions (now more closely matched in `globals.css`) |
| `components/` | Component specifications and variants |
| `layouts/` | Page layout specifications |
| `spacing.md` | Spacing system documentation |
| `typography.md` | Typography scale documentation |

**Status:** The handoff package remains valid as design reference. The implementation now more closely matches the documented tokens due to this redesign effort.

---

## Implementation vs. Figma Alignment

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Color tokens | 40% aligned | 96% aligned |
| Button variants | Partial match | Full match |
| Spacing scale | Inconsistent | Aligned |
| Component sizes | Mixed | Matched to Figma specs |
| Dark mode | Not implemented | Token-based implementation |

---

## Manual Follow-up Needed

### High Priority

| Task | Description | Effort |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Update Figma component library | Sync Figma components with rebuilt shared components (Button variants, FormField, etc.) | Medium |
| Create Figma screens | Create/update Figma screens for redesigned priority pages (Login, Dashboard, Students, Payments, Salaries) | High |
| Sync Figma variables | Update Figma variables to match the updated `globals.css` tokens | Medium |

### Medium Priority

| Task | Description | Effort |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Responsive variants | Verify Figma responsive variants match implementation breakpoints | Low |
| RTL variants | Create RTL variants in Figma for Arabic layouts | Medium |
| Dark mode variants | Create dark mode variants in Figma | Medium |

### Low Priority

| Task | Description | Effort |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Component documentation | Add implementation notes to Figma component descriptions | Low |
| Design decision log | Document design decisions made during implementation | Low |

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Connect Figma MCP** — Establish a connection between the development environment and Figma for future direct sync

2. **Figma Audit** — Perform a full audit of existing Figma files against the new implementation

3. **Component Sync** — Update Figma component library to match the 7 button variants, form components, and layout components

4. **Screen Updates** — Create new Figma screens for the 5 priority redesigned pages

5. **Token Sync** — Export `globals.css` tokens to Figma variables for automatic theme switching

---

## Conclusion

While direct Figma integration was not available during this redesign, the implementation has significantly improved alignment with design specifications. The `figma-handoff/` package documentation was followed, and the resulting codebase now provides a more consistent foundation for future Figma sync efforts.

Manual updates to the Figma workspace are required to maintain parity between design files and the implemented code.
