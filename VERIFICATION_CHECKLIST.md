## Error Handling Tests

### Test 7: Permission Denied
**Action**: Try to suspend as user without edit_students permission
**Expected**:
- Error toast: "لا تملك صلاحية تعديل حالة الطالب" (No permission)
- No tab change
- Student status unchanged

### Test 8: Invalid School
**Action**: Try to change status with no school selected
**Expected**:
- Error toast: "يجب تحديد مدرسة قبل تعديل الطالب" (Select school first)
- No API call made

### Test 9: Network Error
**Action**: Try to suspend with no network (DevTools - Offline mode)
**Expected**:
- No toast (network error)
- Tab doesn't change
- Retry possible

## Console Check

Each action should:
- ✓ NO red errors in console
- ✓ NO 4xx or 5xx API responses
- ✓ NO silent failures
- ✓ Response.ok() === true for all API calls

## Data Integrity Tests

### Test 10: Payments Preserved
After any status change:
```sql
SELECT payments.*, students.status
FROM payments
JOIN students ON payments.student_id = students.id
WHERE students.id = '{test_student_id}';
```
Expected: All payments still exist

### Test 11: History/Logs Preserved
After any status change:
```sql
SELECT * FROM student_activity_log
WHERE student_id = '{test_student_id}'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
Expected: Activity logged correctly

### Test 12: Remaining Fee Calculation
After any status change (especially after payment):
```sql
SELECT id, status, total_fee, paid_fee, remaining_fee, discount_value
FROM students WHERE id = '{test_student_id}';
```
Expected:
- remaining_fee = (total_fee - paid_fee - discount_value)
- remaining_fee is READ-ONLY (generated column)
- No errors on PATCH updating remaining_fee

### Test 13: Branch Scope Maintained
After any status change:
```sql
SELECT school_id, branch_id, status
FROM students WHERE id = '{test_student_id}';
```
Expected: branch_id unchanged

## UI/UX Tests

### Test 14: Tab Refresh
**Steps**:
1. Suspend a student
2. Check active tab - student gone
3. Click suspended tab - student appears
4. **Expected**: Instant refresh, no manual reload needed

### Test 15: Toast Notifications
**Expected messages**:
- Suspend: "تم توقيف الطالب ✓"
- Reactivate: "تم تفعيل الطالب ✓"
- Delete: "تم نقل الطالب للمحذوفين"
- Restore: "تم استعادة الطالب ✓"
- Transfer: "تم نقل الطالب إلى المنقولين ✓"

### Test 16: Loading States
**Expected**:
- Button disabled during request
- "Saving..." indication
- No double-click possible

### Test 17: Menu Closes After Action
**Expected**:
- Dropdown menu closes immediately after action
- No visual glitch
- Ready for next action

## Regression Tests

### Test 18: Edit Still Works
- Edit student details (name, phone, etc.)
- Ensure PATCH endpoint still works with full payload
- Verify no interference with status-only updates

### Test 19: Delete Permanent (force_delete)
- Status: "deleted" student
- Click menu → "حذف نهائي" (Delete Permanently)
- **Expected**: Student hard-deleted from DB (with cascade)
- Verify: Cannot restore

### Test 20: Audit Trail
Check auth/activity logs for:
- Action: "student_status_changed"
- From status → To status
- User ID and timestamp
- School/branch scope
