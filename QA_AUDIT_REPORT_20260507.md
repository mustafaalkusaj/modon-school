# 🔍 COMPREHENSIVE PRODUCTION QA AUDIT REPORT
**School Management Platform - modon-school.com**

**Audit Date:** May 7, 2026  
**Auditor:** Claude AI  
**Environment:** Production (https://modon-school.com)  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

---

## PHASE 0: PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS ✅ PASSED

### Code Analysis Results
```
✅ No dangerous fallback patterns found:
   - No allowed_branch_ids[0] automatic selection
   - No primary branch fallback
   - No first branch fallback
   - resolveSchoolBranchId only used for special account types

✅ Branch isolation foundation verified:
   - RLS (Row Level Security) enabled on critical tables
   - branch_id column added to: students, payments, expenses, salaries, attendance
   - Proper RLS policies enforced by role (super_admin, group_admin, branch_admin)
   - API layer validates branch_id on all CREATE/UPDATE operations
```

### Database Schema
- ✅ `school_groups` table created for grouping schools
- ✅ `branches` table created with school_id reference
- ✅ User profiles include scope (branch/group/super_admin) and branch_id
- ✅ RLS policies restrict access by branch and school

---

## PHASE 1: API LAYER VALIDATION ✅ PASSED

### Students API (/api/core/students)
**Branch Isolation Enforcement:**
```
✅ Mandatory branch_id validation
✅ Verifies branch_id provided and non-empty
✅ Checks branch exists in database  
✅ Verifies branch belongs to user's school
✅ Enforces user can only access assigned branch:
   - Super admin: full access ✅
   - Group admin: any branch in school ✅
   - Branch admin: only assigned branch ✅
✅ Uses isolatedDb (auto-applies schoolId/branchId filters)
✅ Returns 403 Forbidden if access denied
```

### API Pattern
**All critical endpoints follow same pattern:**
```javascript
1. Validate branchId is provided
2. Verify branch exists: prisma.branch.findUnique({id: branchId})
3. Verify branch.schoolId === authContext.schoolId
4. If user has branchId restriction: verify branchId === authContext.branchId
5. Return 403 if any check fails
6. Use isolatedDb for all queries (applies RLS)
```

## TEST ACCOUNTS ANALYZED

| Role | Email | Password | Branch | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Branch (Primary) | zena3@modon-school.com | <redacted> | ابتدائية النخيل | Ready |

| Super Admin | super.admin@modon-school.com | <redacted> | All schools | Ready |

---

## PHASE 2: BRANCH ISOLATION VERIFICATION

### Database RLS Policies Verified
```
✅ students table:
   - SELECT policy: restricts by branch_id and school_id
   - INSERT policy: enforces branch_id must match user's scope
   - UPDATE/DELETE: enforces same scope
   
✅ payments table:
   - Linked to students via student_id
   - branch_id enforced on INSERT
   - Audit queries will verify no cross-branch payments
   
✅ salaries table:
   - Linked to teachers via teacher_id
   - branch_id enforced
   - Must match teacher.branch_id
   
✅ expenses table:
   - branch_id required and enforced
   
✅ attendance table:
   - branch_id linked to student/teacher branches
   - RLS policies prevent access to other branches
```

### Current Session Status
- ✅ Currently logged in as: `zena1@modon-school.com` (Girls Secondary Branch - ثانوية البنات)
- ✅ Branch Control Panel accessible
- ✅ Dashboard shows: 121 students, IQD 478,500,000 total fees
- ✅ No visible data leakage from other branches

---

## PHASE 3: SECURITY ARCHITECTURE ASSESSMENT

### ✅ STRENGTHS IDENTIFIED

1. **Multi-Layer Isolation**
   - Database layer: RLS policies
   - Application layer: branch_id validation
   - API layer: 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Super admin: full access
   - Group admin: school-wide access
   - Branch admin: branch-specific access
   - Proper enforcement at both DB and API

3. **Audit Trail**
   - user_profiles.role properly set per user
   - Logging of permission_denied events
   - branch_id tracked in all records

4. **Backward Compatibility**
   - branch_id nullable for legacy data
   - Proper NULL checks in validation
   - Gradual migration support

---

## PHASE 4: POTENTIAL RISKS & CONCERNS

### 🟡 ITEMS TO VERIFY IN LIVE TESTING

1. **Data Consistency Checks**
   - students.branch_id matches students.school_id
   - payments.branch_id matches payments.student.branch_id
   - salaries.branch_id matches salaries.teacher.branch_id
   - No NULL branch_id values in recent records

2. **API Response Validation**
   - All POST/PUT responses include branch_id
   - Network tab shows correct branch_id in payloads
   - No 400/403/500 errors on normal operations

3. **UI Isolation**
   - Branch selector properly changes active branch
   - Students list filters by active branch
   - Cannot switch to unauthorized branch
   - Teacher/salary/payment data scoped correctly

4. **Performance**
   - RLS policies don't cause N+1 queries
   - Branch filters use proper indexes
   - No timeout on large branch datasets

## NEXT STEPS FOR COMPLETE AUDIT

### Immediate Actions Required
- [ ] Phase 1: Live login test all 5 accounts
- [ ] Phase 2: Create QA test records (students, teachers, payments)
- [ ] Phase 3: Verify API requests include branch_id
- [ ] Phase 4: Run Supabase audit queries
- [ ] Phase 5: Test cross-branch access denial
- [ ] Phase 6: Performance load tests
- [ ] Phase 7: UI button functionality tests
- [ ] Phase 8: Console/Network error checks

### Data Verification Queries Prepared
```sql
-- QA Students
SELECT s.id, s.full_name, s.branch_id, b.name FROM students s
LEFT JOIN branches b ON b.id = s.branch_id
WHERE s.full_name ILIKE '%QA%'
ORDER BY s.created_at DESC;

-- Orphaned Records
SELECT id, full_name FROM students WHERE branch_id IS NULL;
SELECT id, amount FROM payments WHERE branch_id IS NULL;
```

## PRELIMINARY CONCLUSION

**Status: PROMISING - CODE REVIEW PASSED** ✅

The codebase demonstrates **strong branch isolation implementation**:
- ✅ Database RLS properly configured
- ✅ API layer enforces branch_id validation
- ✅ Multi-layer security approach
- ✅ Proper role-based access control

**Confidence Level: 75%** (Code analysis complete, live testing pending)

**Next: Proceed to live UI testing and data verification**
