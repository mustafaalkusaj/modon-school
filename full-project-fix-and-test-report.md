# Full Project Fix And Test Report

## Executive Summary

- Active app verification passed: the process bound to `127.0.0.1:3000` was the root Next.js app in `/Users/musatafa/modon-school`, `/` redirected to `/ar`, and localized login routes loaded from the root app.
- Live authenticated testing was completed with `admin@schoolapp.com` and `super.admin@schoolapp.com`.
- Major runtime issues were reproduced and fixed in code, then re-verified live:
  - auth/RBAC session race conditions that caused blank protected pages and unstable post-login redirects
  - dev CSP behavior that blocked login page inline scripts
  - authenticated locale switching on dashboard
  - teacher activity / fee notification API surfaces failing hard when schema objects were missing
  - English payments drawer and English salaries print modal showing Arabic-only content
- Broad route coverage was re-verified live with screenshots for the main admin and super-admin surfaces.

## What Was Tested

- Active app detection on localhost, locale routing, and localized login entry points
- Authenticated admin routes:
  - `/ar/dashboard`, `/en/dashboard`
  - `/ar/students`, `/en/students`
  - `/ar/payments`, `/en/payments`
  - `/ar/salaries`, `/en/salaries`
  - `/ar/teachers`
  - `/ar/attendance`
  - `/ar/expenses`
  - `/ar/reports`
  - `/ar/monitoring`
  - `/ar/fee-notifications`
- Authenticated super-admin routes:
  - `/ar/super-admin`, `/en/super-admin`
  - `/ar/schools`, `/en/schools`
  - `/ar/subscriptions`, `/en/subscriptions`
  - `/ar/users`, `/en/users`
  - `/ar/access-denied`
  - `/ar/subscription-expired`
- Interactive flows:
  - admin login
  - protected-route redirect to login
  - authenticated Arabic/English locale switching
  - payments detail drawer in English
  - payments receipt print initialization
  - salaries print modal in English
  - salaries full-report print initialization
- Weak-network probe:
  - offline reload of `/ar/dashboard`
- Automated checks:
  - `npm test`
  - `npm run typecheck`
  - targeted ESLint on the changed files
  - Playwright smoke specs run individually after fixes

## What Was Broken

- Login page hit a dev-time CSP violation for inline script execution.
- Authenticated pages could stall blank or bounce back to login because RBAC cookie sync was happening on the critical render path and could race with login settlement.
- Locale switch on authenticated dashboard did not reliably switch locales.
- Activity and fee-notification pages were fragile when expected database objects were absent, causing widget/page failures instead of graceful empty states.
- Some English interactive surfaces still rendered Arabic strings:
  - payments detail drawer
  - salaries print modal

## What Was Fixed

- Moved RBAC synchronization off the critical render path in `hooks/useRole.tsx`.
- Stopped deleting the RBAC session cookie during login/profile settlement when there was no confirmed user yet.
- Added short session-token timeouts and fetch aborts around RBAC/auth header helpers in `lib/auth.ts` and `lib/authorized-api.ts`.
- Relaxed dev-only CSP script handling in `proxy.ts` to avoid breaking the login page while keeping production stricter.
- Switched `components/LanguageToggle.tsx` to a direct locale-aware navigation path that works reliably in authenticated shells.
- Added safe fallbacks in `lib/teacher-activity-server.ts` so missing views/tables return empty data instead of taking down the surface.
- Localized the payments detail drawer and salaries print modal through `messages/en.json` and `messages/ar.json`.
- Added/updated Playwright coverage for:
  - broad authenticated route coverage
  - English interactive locale regressions
  - receipt/report print initialization

## Still Broken

- Full-repo `npm run lint` still fails because of a large pre-existing lint backlog in unrelated files and generated/backup artifacts.
- The app has no offline shell or queue behavior; offline dashboard reload falls through to Chromium’s network error page.
- Some student-management code paths still contain hardcoded Arabic action/toast copy and need a dedicated bilingual cleanup pass.
- Heavy routes are still slow on cold dev loads, especially dashboard/monitoring/expenses/reports.

## Blocked By Environment

- Final sign-off on student credential/access-card printing was not completed in the late-pass browser probe because the dev server was already under heavy route-sweep load and the students page repeatedly timed out during that extra probe.
- Full bundled Playwright execution is still sensitive to dev cold-start timing. The underlying individual specs pass after the fixes, but the combined long run can still overrun when slow route sweeps stack.

## Strongest Parts Of The System

- Core auth now stabilizes correctly across admin and super-admin logins.
- Locale routing and authenticated locale switching are working in live use.
- Main admin and super-admin route groups render successfully under real authenticated sessions.
- Print document generation for payments and salaries is functioning and still initializes the print iframe after the fixes.

## Highest-Risk Remaining Areas

- Students module bilingual completeness, especially action menus and operation feedback text
- Offline/weak-network handling
- Repo-wide lint debt obscuring new static issues
- Cold-load responsiveness for API-heavy routes

## Recommended Next Fixes

1. Move remaining student action/operation strings into locale messages and add a dedicated students-credentials print Playwright regression.
2. Decide whether ESLint should exclude generated/backup artifacts or whether those directories should be cleaned out of the active app tree.
3. Add user-facing offline/weak-network fallback UI instead of allowing hard browser error pages on reload.
4. Reduce cold-start cost on dashboard/monitoring/reports by trimming initial requests and improving server/data path latency.

## Validation Summary

- `npm test`: passed
- `npm run typecheck`: passed
- targeted ESLint on changed files: no errors
- full `npm run lint`: failed due pre-existing repo backlog
- Playwright verified individually after fixes:
  - `tests/e2e/login.smoke.spec.ts`
  - `tests/e2e/auth-navigation.smoke.spec.ts`
  - `tests/e2e/authenticated-locale-switch.smoke.spec.ts`
  - `tests/e2e/critical-route-coverage.smoke.spec.ts`
  - `tests/e2e/interactive-locale-and-print.smoke.spec.ts`
