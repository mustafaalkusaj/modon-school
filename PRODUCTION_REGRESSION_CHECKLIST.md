## Regression Prevention Checklist

### Prevent Blank Page Regressions
```
- [ ] All pages wrapped in <ErrorBoundary>
- [ ] RuntimeBrandingProvider has fallback state
- [ ] Data fetches have loading states
- [ ] No unhandled promise rejections
- [ ] Console clean on load
```

### Prevent Chunk Mismatch Regressions
```
- [ ] Use npm run build (clean build)
- [ ] Test locally: npm run dev → all pages load
- [ ] Never use --prebuilt with old .vercel/output
- [ ] Before --prebuilt: rm -rf .vercel/output .next
- [ ] After deploy: test all pages load
- [ ] If chunk error: revert immediately
```

### Prevent Generated Column Regressions
```
- [ ] API filters out: remaining_fee
- [ ] API filters out: paid_fee
- [ ] Student update never sends these columns
- [ ] Database migration applied: 20260430_fix_remaining_fee_constraint
- [ ] remaining_fee ALWAYS generated (never computed by app)
```

### Prevent Financial Calculation Regressions
```
- [ ] All pages use: buildResolvedStudentFinancials()
- [ ] Fee resolution: class_fees priority > students.total_fee > 0
- [ ] Paid calculation: SUM(payments) scoped by school/branch
- [ ] Remaining: max(total - paid, 0)
- [ ] Status determination uses same logic everywhere
- [ ] Dashboard calls /api/web/payments/overview
- [ ] Payments page calls /api/web/payments/overview
```

### Prevent Import Schema Regressions
```
- [ ] Import code does NOT use: classes.name_ar
- [ ] Import code does NOT use: nameAr, nameEn
- [ ] Import code does NOT use: gradeLevel
- [ ] Import code does NOT use: academic_year_id
- [ ] Column mapping uses: 'Student name', 'Class', 'Section'
- [ ] Validation checks against actual DB schema
- [ ] Error messages clear when column missing
```

### Prevent Login Regressions
```
- [ ] /ar/login page loads (form appears)
- [ ] /en/login page loads (form appears)
- [ ] RuntimeBrandingProvider does not throw
- [ ] Try/catch wraps data fetches
- [ ] Fallback UI on error
- [ ] Console no red errors
```

### Prevent Button Wiring Regressions
```
- [ ] Transfer button has onClick handler
- [ ] Transfer button calls transferStudent() API
- [ ] transferStudent() updates database
- [ ] Suspend button has onClick handler
- [ ] Suspend button calls suspendStudent() API
- [ ] Delete button has onClick handler
- [ ] Delete button shows confirmation modal
- [ ] Restore button visible only in deleted tab
```

### Prevent Protected Routes Regressions
```
- [ ] /ar/students protected by <ProtectedRoute>
- [ ] /ar/payments protected by <ProtectedRoute>
- [ ] /ar/attendance protected by <ProtectedRoute>
- [ ] /ar/branch-overview protected by <ProtectedRoute>
- [ ] Unauth access redirects to /login (NOT blank page)
- [ ] All API endpoints check requireStudentPermission()
- [ ] Scope filter present on all queries
```

## Daily Regression Prevention Habit

```
Morning Check (5 minutes):
✅ npm run typecheck
✅ npm run test
✅ Open https://modon-school.com/ar/login
✅ Open https://modon-school.com/ar/students
✅ Open https://modon-school.com/ar/payments
✅ Open https://modon-school.com/ar/branch-overview
✅ Check Vercel logs for errors
✅ Check Supabase status

If any fails:
❌ STOP - do not proceed
❌ Investigate issue
❌ Document in TROUBLESHOOTING.md
❌ Contact dev team
```

---

## Automated Checks (When Running npm run build)

Should output:
```
✓ TypeScript: 0 errors
✓ Tests: 391/391 passing
✓ Build: Compiled in Xs
✓ ESLint: No errors
✓ No deprecated APIs used
✓ No console.error in startup
```

If any fails:
```
STOP: Fix before deploying
```

---

## Deployment Safety Checklist (Before npx vercel deploy)

```
- [ ] Clean rebuild: rm -rf .next && npm run build
- [ ] All checks pass:
      npm run typecheck ✓
      npm run test ✓
      npm run build ✓
- [ ] If using --prebuilt:
      rm -rf .vercel/output first
      Build locally was successful
- [ ] Vercel build passes: npx vercel build --prod
- [ ] Deployment command ready:
      git push (recommended), or
      npx vercel deploy --prod (if git push unavailable)
```

---

## Post-Deployment Verification (Mandatory After Deploy)

**Within 5 minutes:**
```
- [ ] Deployment shows "Ready" in Vercel
- [ ] /ar/login loads with form (test this URL in browser)
- [ ] /ar/students loads with table
- [ ] /ar/payments loads with data
- [ ] /ar/branch-overview loads with numbers
- [ ] Vercel logs: 0 HTTP 500 errors
```

**If any fails:**
```
REVERT IMMEDIATELY:
1. Vercel Dashboard → Deployments
2. Previous deployment (last "Ready" status)
3. Click "Promote to Production"
4. Wait for revert complete
5. Verify pages load again
6. Document in TROUBLESHOOTING.md
7. Contact dev team
```

**If all pass:**
```
✅ Deployment successful
✅ Continue monitoring for 30 minutes
✅ Test key workflows (add student, add payment)
```
