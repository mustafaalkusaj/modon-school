## Introduction
This document provides comprehensive database design documentation for the school management system. It covers the multi-tenant schema, entity relationships, constraints, indexes, and RLS policies that enforce tenant isolation and role-based access control. It also documents the migration strategy, versioning, schema evolution, indexing strategy, and operational procedures such as backup and recovery. Finally, it includes sample data and common query patterns for major entities.

## Project Structure
The database schema is primarily defined in SQL bootstrap and migration files. The repository includes:
- Bootstrap schema and core RLS policies
- Administrative infrastructure (audit logs, notifications, feature flags, soft deletes)
- Academic records and teacher assignment schema
- Performance indexes and additional indexes
- Database-level constraints for payment consistency and salary uniqueness
- Specialized stored procedures for expense reporting and overview functionality
- Legacy accounting system schema and sample data for reference

## Core Components
This section outlines the principal database components and their roles in the system.

- Schools and Subscriptions
  - Schools define tenants with subscription lifecycle management.
  - Subscriptions track plan, status, and effective dates; a computed end date is maintained per school.
  - Indexes optimize queries by school and status.

- User Profiles and Authentication
  - User profiles link auth users to schools and roles.
  - Soft delete columns are standardized across key entities via administrative infrastructure.

- Academic Records and Managed Accounts
  - Managed user profiles unify student and teacher identities with role scoping.
  - Subjects, teacher assignments, assignments, and grades form the academic record domain.
  - Triggers maintain updated_at timestamps for managed entities.

- Payments and Expenses
  - Payments and expenses are tracked with method, references, and approvals.
  - Database-level constraints ensure payment consistency and salary uniqueness.
  - Specialized stored procedures provide efficient expense reporting and overview functionality.
  - Legacy accounting schema and sample data illustrate historical modeling.

- Administrative Infrastructure
  - Audit logs capture actions with actor metadata.
  - Notifications target recipients with read status.
  - Feature flags and soft-delete support are centrally managed.

## Architecture Overview
The database enforces multi-tenancy and role-based access control through RLS policies and helper functions. Tenant isolation is applied to tables containing a school_id column. Helper functions expose current_app_role and current_school_id to policy expressions.

  - current_school_id(): Returns the user's school_id from user_profiles.
- Tenant Isolation
  - Policies on tables with school_id:
    - Select: super_admin OR school_id = current_school_id().
    - Insert/Update/Delete: super_admin OR school_id = current_school_id(), with appropriate WITH CHECK clauses.
- Specialized Policies
  - user_profiles: select/update insert/delete with role-based checks.
  - schools/subscriptions: super_admin manages; select scoped by current school.

- [migrations/20260403_010000_expenses_performance_and_overview.sql](file://migrations/20260403_010000_expenses_performance_and_overview.sql)

### Backup and Recovery Procedures
- Recommended Approach
  - Use database-native logical backups for full/incremental snapshots.
  - Schedule regular backups and retain multiple retention cycles.
  - Test restore procedures periodically and document steps.
  - Store backups securely and encrypt at rest.
- Audit Trail
  - Maintain audit logs for administrative actions impacting data integrity.

### Data Security Measures and Compliance
- Row Level Security
  - Enforce tenant isolation and role-based access across sensitive tables.
- Audit Logging
  - Capture actor, action, entity, and metadata for compliance reporting.
- Data Loss Prevention
  - Soft delete support and centralized deletion controls.
- Access Controls
  - Least privilege via helper functions and policies.
- **Updated**: Database-Level Constraints
  - Payment consistency functions prevent data inconsistencies at the database level.

### Sample Data and Common Query Patterns
- Sample Data
  - Legacy accounting system includes representative inserts for users, classes, sections, students, fee structures, student fees, payments, installments, invoices, expenses, notifications, and backups.
- Common Queries (by model)
  - User
    - Find by email, by ID, create, verify password, update, list with pagination, delete (soft).
  - Student
    - List with filters (class, search), get by ID with payment summary, get by admission number, create, update, delete (soft), payment summary.
  - Payment
    - List with filters (student, date range), get by ID, create, update, delete, summary by date range, student payments.
  - Expense
    - List with filters (category, approval, date range), get by ID, create, update, approve, delete, summary by date range, categories.
  - **Updated**: Expense Reporting
    - Expense summary with school-wide and filtered totals using school_expenses_summary() function.
    - Expense type overview with usage counts and totals using school_expense_types_overview() function.

## Performance Considerations
- **Updated**: Comprehensive Index Coverage
  - **Primary Indexes**: All tenant-scoped tables now have optimized indexes for common query patterns
    - **students.school_id**: Optimizes school-level student queries and filtering
    - **expenses.school_id**: Improves expense reporting and aggregation by school
    - **payments.student_id**: Enhances student payment history queries and financial reporting
    - **salaries.school_id, teacher_id, month**: Prevents duplicate salary entries and optimizes payroll queries
    - **deductions.school_id, deduction_date, teacher_id**: Efficient deduction tracking and reporting
    - **lecture_prices.school_id, grade**: Optimizes pricing queries by grade level
    - **lesson_times.school_id, session_type, period**: Efficient lesson scheduling queries
  - **Secondary Indexes**: Support for date-range queries, status filtering, and composite lookups
  - **Foreign Key Consistency**: Standardized ON DELETE CASCADE behavior across tenant-scoped tables
  - **Database-Level Constraints**: Payment consistency functions and salary uniqueness constraints ensure data integrity
  - **Stored Procedures**: Specialized functions provide optimized expense reporting with minimal database overhead
  - **Query Performance**: Significantly improved performance for:
    - School administration dashboards
    - Financial reporting and analytics
    - Student payment history views
    - Expense categorization and approval workflows
    - Payroll processing and salary management
    - Expense reporting and overview functionality
- Triggers and Timestamps
  - Updated-at triggers reduce application logic and keep audit trails accurate.
- Partitioning
  - Consider partitioning large tables (e.g., payments, attendance_records, expenses) by date ranges for improved maintenance and query performance.
- Statistics and Vacuum
  - Regularly update statistics and vacuum/analyze to maintain query planner effectiveness.

## Troubleshooting Guide
- RLS Denials
  - Verify current_app_role and current_school_id return expected values for the authenticated user.
  - Confirm user_profiles contains the correct role and school_id.
- Policy Conflicts
  - Remove outdated generic policies before applying tenant policies.
- Index Issues
  - **Updated**: All previously missing indexes have been added in migrations/20260330_000000_add_missing_indexes.sql
  - Verify indexes exist: students.school_id, expenses.school_id, payments.student_id, salaries.school_id, deductions.school_id, lecture_prices.school_id, lesson_times.school_id
  - Check foreign key constraints: attendance_records.school_id uses ON DELETE CASCADE
  - **Updated**: Verify new indexes exist: expenses.school_id, expense_date, created_at; expenses.school_id, expense_type_id, expense_date
- **Updated**: Database-Level Constraint Issues
  - Payment consistency functions: Ensure recompute_student_payment_totals and sync_student_payment_totals_from_payments triggers are functioning correctly
  - Salary uniqueness constraints: Verify unique index on (school_id, teacher_id, month) exists and prevents duplicate entries
- **Updated**: Stored Procedure Issues
  - Expense reporting functions: Verify school_expenses_summary and school_expense_types_overview functions exist and are executable by authenticated users
  - Grant permissions: Ensure EXECUTE permissions are granted to authenticated and service_role users
- Audit Logs
  - Check audit_logs for failed operations and actor metadata to diagnose access problems.

## Conclusion
The school management system employs a robust multi-tenant schema with strong RLS enforcement, centralized administrative infrastructure, and a well-defined migration strategy. The recent indexing improvements and database-level constraints have significantly enhanced query performance and data integrity across all major functional areas. The addition of specialized stored procedures for expense reporting and database-level constraints for payment consistency and salary uniqueness ensures reliable, scalable, and secure operations across schools, students, payments, academic records, expenses, salaries, and administrative functions.
