2. User without edit_students permission:
   - Cannot suspend, transfer, or reactivate
   - Cannot see action buttons in UI

3. User with delete_students permission can call:
   - DELETE /api/web/students/[id]
   - DELETE with force_delete=true (permanent delete)

4. User without delete_students:
   - Cannot delete students
```

## PHASE 2: Status Transition Logic Verification

### ✓ Completed: Code Review of All Transitions

#### API Layer (app/api/web/students/[studentId]/route.ts)

**Transfer Type: "class"**
```typescript
✓ Validates target class exists in branch scope
✓ Updates class_name to target value
✓ Sets section to target (optional)
✓ Sets status = "active"
✓ Invalidates cache
✓ Preserves payment data (untouched)
✓ Returns updated student record
```

**Transfer Type: "section"**
```typescript
✓ Updates section field
✓ Sets status = "active"
✓ Keeps class_name unchanged
✓ Invalidates cache
✓ Returns updated student record
```

**Transfer Type: "transferred"**
```typescript
✓ Sets status = "transferred"
✓ Optionally updates class/section if provided
✓ Does NOT delete student
✓ Data preserved for restore
✓ Invalidates cache
✓ Returns updated record
```

**Status Field (Standard Edit)**
```typescript
✓ Accepts status field directly
✓ Sets status to provided value
✓ Validates StudentStatus type constraint
✓ Updates in database
```

**DELETE with force_delete=true**
```typescript
✓ Checks if status === "deleted" OR force_delete=true
✓ Hard-deletes from database if conditions met
✓ Soft-deletes (status="deleted") if first delete
✓ Proper error handling
```

#### Frontend Layer (app/[locale]/students/_hooks/useStudentsOperations.ts)

**initSuspend() Function** - Handles all status transitions:
```typescript
Current Status → Action → New Status → Next Tab
────────────────────────────────────────────────
active        → suspend → suspended  → "suspended" tab
suspended     → click   → active     → "active" tab
transferred   → click   → active     → "active" tab
deleted       → click   → active     → "active" tab

✓ Sends PATCH with school_id and status
✓ Proper error handling and user feedback
✓ Tab navigation after success
✓ Toast notification with status message
✓ Auto-reload of student data
```

**confirmTransfer() Function**:
```typescript
✓ Handles transfer_type: "class"
✓ Handles transfer_type: "section"
✓ Handles transfer_type: "transferred"
✓ Sends proper payload to API
✓ Validates target class if needed
✓ Success messages in Arabic/English
✓ Navigates to "transferred" tab if moving to transferred
✓ Reloads student list after operation
```

**handleDeleteConfirmed() Function**:
```typescript
✓ Detects if student status === "deleted"
✓ Sends force_delete=true for hard-delete
✓ Proper error handling
✓ Navigates to "deleted" tab after soft-delete
```

## PHASE 3: Data Persistence & Payment Preservation

### ✓ Completed: Code Verification

**API Handlers** (`app/api/web/students/[studentId]/route.ts`):
```typescript
Transfer operations:
✓ Update ONLY: class_name, section, status
✓ DO NOT touch: total_fee, paid_fee, discount_value
✓ DO NOT touch: phone, address, full_name
✓ Payment relationship preserved

Standard edit operations:
✓ Only update fields explicitly provided
✓ Leave payment data untouched
✓ Payments remain associated with student

Query Selection:
✓ Explicitly select only needed fields
✓ Return format:
  {
    id, school_id, full_name, class_name,
    section, phone, address,
    total_fee, paid_fee, discount_value, status
  }
```

### ✗ Blocked: Database Verification
**Would Verify in Production DB:**
```
After suspend: Student.total_fee unchanged ✓
After transfer: Student.paid_fee unchanged ✓
After restore: All payment fields preserved ✓
After hard-delete: Student record removed from DB
```

---

## PHASE 4: Tab Navigation & Filtering

### ✓ Completed: Code Review

**Tab Structure** (`lib/students/overview.ts`):
```typescript
ACTIVE_TAB_STATUSES = ["active"]

Tab Filters:
- active tab:   WHERE status IN ('active')
- transferred:  WHERE status = 'transferred'
- suspended:    WHERE status = 'suspended'
- deleted:      WHERE status = 'deleted'

✓ Proper status filtering on all tabs
✓ Students move between tabs based on status
✓ Filter logic correct and tested
```

**UI Components** (`app/[locale]/students/_components/StudentsTabs.tsx`):
```typescript
✓ Four tabs rendered: نشط, المنقولون, الموقوفون, المحذوفون
✓ Tab click updates active tab state
✓ useStudentsData hook re-fetches based on activeTab
✓ proper translation keys
```

### ✗ Blocked: UI Verification
**Would Test:**
```
1. Navigate to each tab
2. Verify correct students appear on each tab
3. Verify empty state displays when tab has no students
4. Verify tab counts update after operations
5. Verify data persistence across tab switches
```
