[  ] Click on "Boys Secondary" in branch selector
     Expected: Page updates to show only Boys Secondary students
     
[  ] Click on "Girls Secondary"
     Expected: Page updates to show only Girls Secondary students
     
[  ] Students visible change based on selected branch
     ✓ PASS if: Data updates correctly without page reload

## 📊 PHASE 3: CRUD OPERATIONS TESTS

### Test 3.1: Create QA Test Records - Primary Branch

**Account: zena3**

**Create Student:**
```

     Status: Active
     
[  ] Submit form
     Expected: Student created successfully
     Expected: Student appears in list immediately (no refresh needed)
     
[  ] Verify in Network tab:
     Expected POST /api/core/students payload contains:
     {
       "nameAr": "QA طالب ابتدائية",
       "nameEn": "QA Primary Student Full Audit",
       "branchId": "<UUID matching Primary branch>",
       "schoolId": "<UUID of Al-Nakheel>",
       ...
     }
     
     Expected Response Status: 201 Created
     Expected Response includes: student.id, student.branch_id
```

**Verify in Supabase:**
```
SELECT id, full_name, branch_id, school_id, created_at
FROM students
WHERE full_name ILIKE '%QA%' AND full_name ILIKE '%ابتدائية%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

[  ] Verify API request:
     {
       "studentId": "<QA student UUID>",
       "amount": 10000,
       "branchId": "<Primary UUID>",
       "schoolId": "<Al-Nakheel UUID>"
     }
     
[  ] Verify student's remaining_fee decreases
     Verify in next request: balance updates correctly
```

### Test 3.2: Read Operations - Verify Filtering

```
[  ] QA Students created in Primary appear only in Primary branch
     
[  ] Search for "QA": Should find QA students
     
[  ] Search for "QA" while viewing Boys Secondary: Should NOT find QA
     (because they're in Primary)
     
[  ] Switch branch to Primary: QA students appear
     
[  ] Filter by class: QA students appear correctly
     
[  ] Sort by date: QA students appear in correct order
```

### Test 3.3: Update Operations

## 🛡️ PHASE 4: SECURITY & AUTHORIZATION TESTS

### Test 4.1: Unauthorized Branch Access - API Level

**Using Browser DevTools or curl:**

```bash
# Get authentic request from Network tab first
# Replace branchId with UUID of different branch

curl -X POST https://modon-school.com/api/core/students \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {zena3_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "nameAr": "Hacker Attempt",
    "nameEn": "Unauthorized Student",
    "branchId": "boys-secondary-branch-uuid",
    "classId": "some-class-uuid"
  }'

Expected Response:
Status: 403 Forbidden
Body: {
  "error": "Forbidden: You do not have access to this branch"
}

✗ FAIL if: Status 200 or 201 (means authorization bypassed)
✗ FAIL if: Student created in wrong branch
```

### Test 4.2: No Branch Access - Empty List

```
[  ] Login as zena3 (Primary branch only)
[  ] Open /ar/students
[  ] Verify the list shows ONLY Primary students
     
[  ] In Network tab, inspect API response
     Verify: All returned students have branch_id = Primary UUID
     
[  ] Count in UI vs API:
     Verify: Numbers match (no hidden data)
```

### Test 4.3: Database Consistency - No Orphaned Records

**Supabase SQL Queries:**

```sql
-- 1. Check for students with NULL branch_id (recent records)
SELECT COUNT(*) as orphaned_students
FROM students
WHERE branch_id IS NULL
  AND created_at > now() - interval '7 days'
  AND deleted_at IS NULL;

Expected Result: 0 rows

-- 2. Check payment/student branch mismatch
SELECT COUNT(*) as mismatches
FROM payments p
JOIN students s ON s.id = p.student_id
WHERE p.branch_id <> s.branch_id
  AND p.deleted_at IS NULL;

Expected Result: 0 rows

-- 3. Check salary/teacher branch mismatch
SELECT COUNT(*) as mismatches
FROM salaries sa
JOIN teachers t ON t.id = sa.teacher_id
WHERE sa.branch_id <> t.branch_id
  AND sa.deleted_at IS NULL;

Expected Result: 0 rows

-- 4. Verify QA records in correct branches
SELECT 
  s.id,
  s.full_name,
  s.branch_id,
  b.name as branch_name,
  s.created_at
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN branches b ON b.id = s.branch_id
WHERE s.full_name ILIKE '%QA%'
ORDER BY s.created_at DESC;

Expected: Each QA record shows correct branch_name
```
