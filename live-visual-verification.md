# Live Visual Verification

Generated: 2026-04-10  
Active app: `http://localhost:3000`  
Verification method: live Playwright browser capture + direct screenshot review

## Root App Verification

- `curl -I http://localhost:3000/en/login` returned `200 OK`
- the live pages reflect changes made in the root repo under `/Users/musatafa/modon-school`
- nested legacy folders were not serving the captured routes
- locale routes resolved through the intended root app implementation

## Authenticated QA Strategy Used

- login credentials: `admin@schoolapp.com / Admin@12345`
- protected-route language switching verified through [`tests/e2e/authenticated-locale-switch.smoke.spec.ts`](/Users/musatafa/modon-school/tests/e2e/authenticated-locale-switch.smoke.spec.ts)
- login smoke verified through [`tests/e2e/login.smoke.spec.ts`](/Users/musatafa/modon-school/tests/e2e/login.smoke.spec.ts)
- screenshot proof generated through [`tests/e2e/redesign-visual-capture.spec.ts`](/Users/musatafa/modon-school/tests/e2e/redesign-visual-capture.spec.ts)
- print flows now use a shared hidden iframe helper instead of opening a new popup tab

## Routes Visually Verified

### Light Mode

- `/ar/login` → `output/playwright/redesign-verification/login-ar-light.png`
- `/en/login` → `output/playwright/redesign-verification/login-en-light.png`
- `/ar/dashboard` → `output/playwright/redesign-verification/dashboard-ar-light.png`
- `/en/dashboard` → `output/playwright/redesign-verification/dashboard-en-light.png`
- `/ar/students` → `output/playwright/redesign-verification/students-ar-light.png`
- `/en/students` → `output/playwright/redesign-verification/students-en-light.png`
- `/ar/payments` → `output/playwright/redesign-verification/payments-ar-light.png`
- `/en/payments` → `output/playwright/redesign-verification/payments-en-light.png`
- `/ar/salaries` → `output/playwright/redesign-verification/salaries-ar-light.png`
- `/en/salaries` → `output/playwright/redesign-verification/salaries-en-light.png`

### Dark Mode Spot Checks

- `/ar/login` → `output/playwright/redesign-verification/login-ar-dark.png`
- `/en/dashboard` → `output/playwright/redesign-verification/dashboard-en-dark.png`
- `/en/students` → `output/playwright/redesign-verification/students-en-dark.png`
- `/en/payments` → `output/playwright/redesign-verification/payments-en-dark.png`
- `/en/salaries` → `output/playwright/redesign-verification/salaries-en-dark.png`

## Before / After Summary

- before this pass, the live root app already had a partial redesign but still had blocked font loading, incomplete runtime tokens, a less visible language switcher, fragile dashboard widget failures, and visibly mixed-language `payments`/`salaries` screens in English mode
- after this pass, the live root app shows repaired fonts, visible bilingual shell controls, resilient dashboard widgets, and much cleaner English route shells for `payments` and the default `salaries` view

## Theme Notes

- light mode remains the primary visual direction on all verified routes
- dark mode regressions were spot-checked on the priority routes above
- runtime branding preset switching was not fully re-verified in this pass and still needs follow-up

## Live Status

The redesigned UI is visibly live for the shared shell, login, dashboard resilience work, and the route-shell localization improvements to `payments` and `salaries`.
The final stabilization pass also moved receipt/report/credential printing into the shared iframe print helper so print actions stay in the current browser surface instead of opening a new tab.

## Remaining Verification Gaps

- full route-group verification is still missing for `fee-notifications`, `monitoring`, `teachers`, `attendance`, `expenses`, `reports`, and the full super-admin surface
- nested `payments` and `salaries` modals/drawers still need the same level of bilingual verification
- a manual spot-check of the native browser print dialog is still recommended for one receipt and one long report to confirm local printer defaults
